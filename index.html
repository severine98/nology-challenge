            <h4>A bit about me</h4>
            <p class="click">I am a French bilingual who lived in the suburbs of Paris for 12 years before moving to
                London and obtaining my French Baccalaureat in Economics at the Lycee Francais Charles de Gaulle. In
                July 2019, I received my degree in BSc Psychology from the University of Exeter. Since then, I have
                moved back to London and worked in operations for IWG plc until February 2020. I spent the following
                month backpacking accross Australia.</p>

            <h4>My hobbies and interests</h4>
            <p class="click">I have been playing badminton since the age of 7 and can't get enough! During my free
                time I enjoy meeting up with friends, going out for drinks and trying out new foods...yum! I absolutely
                love travelling and learning about new cultures, recently the kitchen has been my favourite destination.
                Also, music is a must for my day-to-day routine, festivals are where you'll
                find me in the summer. </p>

        <section id="section-3">
            <h4>Why this course?</h4>
            <p class="click">After realising I did not want to pursue Psychology as a career, I found an interest in
                coding. I gave it a go and was surprised that I enjoyed it, as I feel like programming was absolutely
                terrifying at first, anyone agree?
                As I will not be spending my summer camping in some muddy festival, I have opted for the next best
                thing!!!
                This course is the perfect starting point for my software development career! I am excited to learn new
                skills and
                meet new people!
